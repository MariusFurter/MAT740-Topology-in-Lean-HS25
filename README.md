# MAT740-Topology-in-Lean-HS25

**Welcome to Topology in Lean!**

In this course, we will formalize the main definitions and theorems of point-set topology in [Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org). We will allow ourselves to use everything in [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) apart from `Mathlib.Topology`.

This material was adapted from https://github.com/miguelmarco/topologia_general_lean.

1. Introduction to Lean
